## Overview

Text displays... text! It's used in place of `TextLabel` and `TextButton` engine components.

## How to Use

In normal cases, you can replace `TextLabel` and `TextButton` with `Text` directly. Note that some properties have been put into tables to improve structure and compatibility with style tokens.

`Text` also supports state updates with the `onStateChanged` callback, which gives updates on hover, press, select, and more. In most cases, a [[Button]] with the `TextButton` variant should be used instead of `Text` for interactive elements.

!!! danger "Performance Notice"

    `onStateChanged` callback function should **never** be declared locally in a render function. For functional components, declare them in a `useCallback` hook and focus on reducing dependencies as much as possible. For class components declare them in the `Init` function.

    To reduce the number of re-renders, use `Bindings` as much as possible when driving prop changes.

See how to style `Text` quickly with the [[Style Tags]].

```lua
local Foundation = require(Packages.Foundation)
local Text = Foundation.Text
...

local onStateChanged = React.useCallback(function(state)
    print("Text state changed", state)
end, {})

return React.createElement(Text, {
    Text = "Hello world!",
    onStateChanged = onStateChanged,
    tag = "padding-small grow size-1400",
})
```
